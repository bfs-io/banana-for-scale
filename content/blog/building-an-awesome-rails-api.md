title: Building a Rails API
description: Using Ruby on Rails to build a RESTful JSON API with MySQL DB
---
Need an API? Ruby on Rails presents a strong argument for an API framework. True, there are some [Performance Considerations](https://www.mskog.com/posts/42-performance-tips-for-ruby-on-rails/) to take into account and we probably won't be seeing those [sub-millisecond](https://www.speedshop.co/2015/05/27/100-ms-to-glass-with-rails-and-turbolinks.html) performances that we might see if we were using something like [Elixr](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/testing-a-phoenix-elixir-json-api) - enter Haskell, but there are still plenty of valid reasons for choosing Ruby on Rails for an API.

* Active Record, despite its flaws, is still quite useful for a quick CRUD-based application where the Model is relatively flat (eg. not a lot of class hierarchies). There are [alternatives](https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails) to AR that we won't discuss here and for this tutorial we will be working with AR.
* Ruby on Rails is written in Ruby, a dynamic, general-purpose programming language. Also RoR is a mature framework which means refined and stable code.
* Building applications in RoR is fast and easy, which is an excellent choice if youâ€™re on a tight budget and/or under tight deadlines.

### Bonus

Ruby 3.0 is scheduled to release this December with claims of a 3x3 performance boost from [Matz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9R7PUCEXo)

### So ...

Shall we explore this Rails API thing?

### Getting Started

This tutorial will cover building the application on OS X using Rails 6 and Ruby 2.7.0

Apple bundles Ruby with OS X, however, for development purposes we should use RVM for managing our own builds and versions. Here is an [article](https://usabilityetc.com/articles/ruby-on-mac-os-x-with-rvm/) from Jeffrey Morgan explaining some of the setup with this configuration.

### Deploy Early and Often

Heroku is a great choice for RoR development and offers a service at no-cost to get started. For this tutorial, let assume we've named our application in Heroku:

```
awesome-rails-api
```

According to the official Rails documentation, if we want to create an "API-only" version of Rails, we can do so by passing the `--api` parameter when we run the `rails new` command. Make sure you've installed rails with `gem install rails`. We're also going to pass `--database` along with the command and create the MySQL database.

```
rails new awesome-rails-api --api --database=mysql
```

Next we will run `bundle install` and `rake db:create` in the `awesome-rails-api` directory. But first, let's setup our development and production values in the `config/database.rb` file for such things as our database names.

Because we selected the JawsDB MySQL resource, we notice that the value has been set for the `JAWSDB_URL` key in the config vars section under the settings for the Heroku app. In `config/database.rb`, our production settings contain this key wrapped in a syntax to be read as an environment variable.

```
production:
  <<: *default
  url: <%= ENV['JAWSDB_URL'] %>
```

Next, Heroku wants a `Procfile` to load the Puma webserver configuration at `config/puma.rb`

We make the Profile and load the one-liner into the file:

```
echo "web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb" >> Procfile
```

We configure the `config/puma.rb` according to the [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server) and get ready to test the server locally.

We run the server locally with:

```
rails server
```

Our server seems to run and we visit the application at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

We see our first error in big scary red and white type!
