## Theoritical Musings

### What is a Theory?

A theory can be defined as a rational form of abstract perspectives or thinking concerning the results of such thinking or a phenomenon. The process of rational and contemplative thinking is mostly associated with processes such as research or observational study.

As such, a theory can be considered to belong to both scientific and non-scientific disciplines. Theories can also belong to no discipline.

From a modernistic scientific approach, a theory can mean scientific theories that have been well confirmed to explain nature and that are created in such a way that they are consistent with the standard scientific method. A theory should fulfill all the criteria required by modern-day science. 

A theory should be described in a way that scientific tests that have been conducted can provide empirical support or contradiction to the theory.

Because of the nature by which scientific theories are developed, they tend to be the most rigorous, reliable, and comprehensive when it comes to describing and supporting scientific knowledge. 

The connection between a theory and a hypothesis is that when a theory has not yet been proven, it can be referred to as a hypothesis.

The thing about theories is that they are not meant to help the scientist or researcher reach a particular goal. Rather, a theory is meant to guide the process of finding facts about a phenomenon or an observation. 

### Difference between a Theory and Thesis

A theory is a rational form of abstract perspectives or thinking concerning the results of such thinking or a phenomenon. The process of rational and contemplative thinking is mostly associated with processes such as research or observational study. On the other hand, a thesis is a written piece of academic work that is submitted by students to attain a university degree.

It denotes academic papers that are written by students in the university, especially those pursuing postgraduate degrees, at the end of their courses to demonstrate their proficiency in their disciplines and the topics they have selected for research.
