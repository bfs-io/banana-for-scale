## Hypothesis & Supporting Thesis

### How to write a Good Hypothesis
1. Asking a question

Asking a question is the first step in the scientific method and the question should be based on who, what, where, when, why, and how. The question should be focused, specific, and researchable.
2. Gathering preliminary research 

This is the process of collecting relevant data. It can be done by researching academic journals, conducting case studies, observing phenomena, and conducting experiments. 
3. Formulating an answer

When the research is completed, you should think of how best to answer the question and defend your position. The answer to your question should be objective. 
4. Writing the hypothesis

When your answer is ready, you can move to the next step of formulating the hypothesis. A good hypothesis should contain relevant variables, predicted outcomes, and a study group that can include non-human things. The hypothesis should not be a question but a complete statement. 
5. Refining the hypothesis

Though you may skip this step, it is advisable to include it because your study may involve two groups or be a correlational study. Refining the hypothesis will ensure that you have stated the difference or relationship you expect to find. 
6. Creating a null and alternative hypotheses

A null hypothesis (H0) will postulate that there is no evidence to support the difference. On the other hand, an alternative hypothesis (H1) posits that there is evidence in support of the difference. 

### Difference between thesis and hypothesis example

Thesis: High levels of alcohol consumption have detrimental effects on your health, such as weight gain, heart disease, and liver complications.

Hypothesis: The people who consume high levels of alcohol experience detrimental effects on their health such as weight gain, heart disease, and liver complications. 
What is the difference between a summary and a thesis statement?

A summary is a brief account or statement of the main points from the researches. A thesis statement is a statement that is written at the end of the introduction of a research paper or essay that summarizes the main claims of the paper. 
Difference between hypothesis and statement of the problem

A hypothesis can be defined as the proposed or suggested explanation for an occurrence, something, or a phenomenon. The same should be testable through scientific methods. Conversely, a statement of a problem is a concise description of the issue to be addressed on how it can be improved. 

### What is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis can be defined as the proposed or suggested explanation for an occurrence, something, or a phenomenon. It should be testable through scientific methods. The reason why scholarly works should have a hypothesis is that the observed phenomena could not be explained using the prevailing scientific theories hence the reason why it should be tested. 

Testing the hypothesis may result in the development of new or improved scientific theories that are beneficial to the discipline and society in general. 

### What is a Thesis?

A thesis is a written piece of academic work that is submitted by students to attain a university degree. When a thesis is used as a stand-alone word, it denotes academic papers written by university students. It is mostly written by those pursuing postgraduate degrees, at the end of their courses. They demonstrate their proficiency in their disciplines and the topics they have selected for research. 

However, when a thesis is used to refer to a statement, it denotes the statement that is written at the introduction of a research paper or essay. A thesis is supported by a credible argument.

Every research paper must have a thesis statement that acts as a guide to what the research will be all about. It is possible to receive very poor grades or even score a zero if your research paper lacks the thesis statement. 

### Difference between Hypothesis and Thesis

There are major differences between hypothesis and thesis. While they seem to be related on the face, their differences are huge both in concept and practice.

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation of something or a phenomenon. A scientific hypothesis uses a scientific method that requires any hypothesis to be tested. As such, scientists and researchers base their hypothesis on observations that have been previously made and that which cannot be explained by the available or prevailing scientific theories.

From the definition of a hypothesis, you can see that theories must be included in any scientific method. This is the reason why this article tries to differentiate a thesis, a hypothesis, and a theory. 

Moving forward, a thesis can be defined as a written piece of academic work that is submitted by students to attain a university degree. However, on a smaller scale, there is something that is referred to as a thesis statement.

This is written at the introduction of a research paper or essay that is supported by a credible argument. The link between a hypothesis and thesis is that a thesis is a distinction or an affirmation of the hypothesis.

What this means is that whenever a research paper contains a hypothesis, there should be a thesis that validates it.
